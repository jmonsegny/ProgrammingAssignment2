## Jorge Monsegny 2016
## This is the second assignment of the course R
## Programming from the JHU-Coursera Data Science
## Specialization.
## The objective is to write two functions that 
## use R lexical scoping to avoid the matrix inverse
## calculation by returning a cached result whenever 
## is possible. 

## This function receives a matrix and returns
## a list with setter and getter functions for
## the matrix and its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function receives a list returned by
## the makeCacheMatrix function and returns
## the inverse of the matrix only is it was
## not previously calculated.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
